Requires at least: 2.0
Tested up to: 2.9.1
Stable tag: 0.3

Allows your users to submit and vote for your posts on JapanSoc.com.

== Description ==

This plugins allows your readers to easily submit your blog posts to (JapanSoc.com)[http://www.japansoc.com], a social bookmarking website for everything Japan-related, and then automatically shows how many votes, or socs, your article has received from other JapanSoc'ers.

= Usage: =

* Insert either "&lt;!--japansocleft--&gt;" or "&lt;!--japansocright--&gt;" (without quotes) into your posts where you want the
button to appear using the HTML editor.
* Alternatively, you can use the HTML editor buttons labeled **JSoc-L** and **JSoc-R**

= Notes: =

1. This feature won't work in the Rich Text Editor. You have to use the HTML editor.

2. - The difference between 0.2 and the previous 0.1 version of this plugin is 
the left/right alignment option directly in your post. The tag "&lt;!--japansoc--&gt;" used in version 0.1 still works and defaults to the left.
   - V.3 uses a different url to make the plugin compatible with the latest version of JapanSoc. All previously linked buttons will still be okay.
